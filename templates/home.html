        <h2 id="why-predict">Why Predict Flight Delays?</h2>
        <p>Flight delay prediction helps airlines and passengers manage their time better. By predicting delays, passengers can adjust their travel plans, and airlines can allocate resources more effectively.</p>

        <h2 id="how-it-works">How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>Flight delay prediction models use a variety of data sources to make predictions. These sources can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Historical flight data (departure/arrival times, delays)</li>
            <li>Weather conditions (wind speed, visibility, precipitation)</li>
            <li>Air traffic information (congestion, route restrictions)</li>
            <li>Airport data (gate availability, runway closures)</li>
            <li>Real-time flight tracking data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Machine learning algorithms are trained on this data to identify patterns and predict future delays.  These models can be quite complex, taking into account various factors and their interrelationships.</p>


        <h2 id="key-steps">Key Steps in Flight Delay Prediction</h2>
        <p>The key steps involved in flight delay prediction typically include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering relevant data from various sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling. This might involve handling missing values, converting data types, and feature engineering.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Selection:</strong> Identifying the most important variables that contribute to flight delays.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Training a machine learning model on the historical data.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Assessing the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Implementing the model to make real-time predictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring and Refinement:</strong> Continuously monitoring the model's performance and retraining it as needed to maintain accuracy.</li>
        </ol>
