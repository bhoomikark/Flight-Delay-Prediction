✈️ Flight Delay Prediction
This project predicts whether a flight will be delayed using machine learning models trained on historical flight data. The goal is to help understand patterns and key factors that contribute to flight delays.

🔧 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas & NumPy – for data preprocessing and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for visualizing trends and correlations

Scikit-learn – for building and evaluating machine learning models

  Visual Studio  – for interactive development and analysis

📊 Features
Cleaned and processed historical flight data

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify delay patterns

Applied feature engineering techniques to improve model performance

Built classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict delays

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/bhoomikark/flight-delay-prediction.git
cd flight-delay-prediction
Open the Jupyter Notebook

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Flight_Delay_Prediction.ipynb
Run the notebook cell by cell to view preprocessing, visualizations, and model results

📁 Dataset
Includes columns such as: Airline, Date, Departure Time, Arrival Time, Flight Duration, Weather Info, and Delay Status

Delay status is the target variable (e.g., Delayed or On Time)
